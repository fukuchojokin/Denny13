* Concept of [S. Sigdel](https://twitter.com/sashantsigdel)
* Created by [Bestware](https://twitter.com/kshitizwagle)
* Might be available in [KlutchKyle repo](https://klutchkyle.com) 

* Requires Xen HTML and XenInfo. 
* Put the (if)downloaded folder in /var/mobile/Library/LockHTML or /var/mobile/Library/SBHTML.

Surely is broken in bigger devices cause I suck at creating for them.
